    This is a Second Semester Mini-Project of Machine Learning course, a simple research compare different models in Regression and Classification. The research based on Pytorch toolkit and 8 group of collected mobile data, and preprocessed by Spark. The reporter selected the deep neural network (LSTM) and the random forest model.

    Try to use U-Net for automatic retinal lesion segmentation in color fundus.

    We implement a general approach for automatic retinal lesion segmentation in color fundus image based on deep learning U-Net model . Our network achieves good performance in some cases. But, Our current defects in this task is a little overfitting due to training data is too little, it only contains 54 images with masks. And we think it could be extended by rotate.
